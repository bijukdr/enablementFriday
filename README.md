## Enablement Friday

Hi guys!

Thomas put me in the driving seat for our enablement on Friday.

I'll give you a minute to let that sink in...

Meanwhile, let me take the opportunity to thank you for the past 5 months:

As you might know I ran my own tiny business prior joining DataRobot and this is literally my first permanent role ever. As such it took some getting used to it all - and still does. And while I had and still do have moments questioning this choice in life, you all helped ease that pain significantly. Not least Thomas in our 1/1s.

So thanks to all of you!

What school of thought/management it was that made the very same Thomas decide to have the least knowledgeable guy in the team conduct a team training, has not yet fully transpired.

On the upside, it should be a short Friday. So let's get started:

You'll need

- your workstation
- Internet access
- files from https://github.com/floriankessler/enablementFriday
- docker running
- access to our SaaS

The format of the enablement will be challenge / hint / solution.

On Friday

- at 0900 we'll kick it off. For that I'll update the repo's `README.md` on Friday with the challenges and walk you through it.

  - Task 1 - Name model types and deployment options
  - Task 2 - Create and store a model locally
  - Task 3 - Predict locally using the previously generated model
  - Task 4 - Monitor the model with DR MLOps
    - 4.1 Create and deploy a new Model Package in DataRobot.
    - 4.2 Build a docker image containing the monitoring agent
    - 4.3 Create spooler (rabbitmq)
    - 4.4 Adapt the agent's config to use rabbitmq
    - 4.5 Run the agent within docker using your config
    - 4.6 Instrument and monitor the app

  For hints feel free to ping me everytime. Should it be relevant for the team, I'll create/update `Hints.md` in the repo and inform you on #emea-ai-delivery-private.

- at 1200 we'll reconvene to see how things are going.
- at 1430 we'll have a look at the solutions.

Looking forward to it!
Florian
